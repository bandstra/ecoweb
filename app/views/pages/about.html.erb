Ecoweb is a research and teaching tool designed to catalog and analyze the organic life within the ecosphere of the Outdoor Discovery Center near Holland, Michigan. Wow! That's a mouthful!

<p>
Actually, this is the purpose of the project. Ecoweb will become a catalog of the creatures and plants that have been sighted within the Outdoor Discovery Center. It's up to you to see, classify and record anything you find.
